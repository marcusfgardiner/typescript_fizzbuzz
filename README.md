# typescript_fizzbuzz

Questions from the exercise:
* A lot of scenarios to test - way of making tests cleaner?
* Debugging features?
* ES6 syntax for TS + Transpiling?
* Purpose: Take time to learn, refactor a lot, aim for quality + notes? Or aim to get through tasks quickly?
* Should I be declaring more types anywhere? e.g. in my tests
* Ambiguity: later instructions don't agree with prior instructions - which to choose? e.g. BONG only versus FezzBong. How about FizzFezzBong - should it only be FezzBong?
* Instructions not written in the way to best implement the code
